Cancer Stem Cells Trajectory Inference and Pseudotime Analysis
This project performs trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis on cancer stem cells (CSCs) to identify cellular transitions from stemness to differentiation. The analysis uses single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GSE119469 dataset, available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

Data Source
Dataset: GSE119469 (Breast Cancer Stem Cell Data)
Data Link: GSE119469 on GEO
Description: The dataset contains single-cell RNA sequencing data of breast cancer stem cells and their non-stem counterparts. It provides a comprehensive look at the gene expression profiles of these cells, which can be analyzed to understand the trajectory from stemness to differentiation.
Download the Dataset
Navigate to the GSE119469 page on GEO.
Download the raw counts data (usually in .tar.gz or .txt format).
Place the downloaded file in the data/raw directory.

data/raw/: This directory contains the raw data files from GEO.
data/processed/: This directory contains processed data ready for analysis.
scripts/: This directory contains the necessary scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
preprocess_data.sh: A Bash script to download and preprocess the raw data.
trajectory_inference_analysis.R: An R script for performing trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis.
Requirements
R Packages:

Seurat: For creating Seurat objects and performing basic analysis.
monocle3: For performing trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis.
ggplot2: For visualizing results.
dplyr: For data manipulation.
Bash: For downloading and preprocessing the raw data.

Installing Required R Packages
Run the following commands to install the necessary R packages if you don't have them already:

R
Copy code
install.packages(c("Seurat", "monocle3", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
Instructions
1. Download the Dataset
Download the raw counts data from GEO and place it in the data/raw directory.

2. Preprocess Data
Run the preprocess_data.sh script to download and organize the raw data files:

bash
Copy code
bash scripts/preprocess_data.sh
This will:

Download the raw data from GEO (replace the link with the actual URL).
Unzip and extract the data.
Organize the data into the data/processed directory.
3. Perform Trajectory Inference and Pseudotime Analysis
Once the data is preprocessed, run the R script to perform the analysis:

bash
Copy code
Rscript scripts/trajectory_inference_analysis.R
This script will:

Load and preprocess the data using Seurat.
Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA).
Convert the data into a monocle3 CellDataSet (CDS) for trajectory analysis.
Perform clustering and learn the trajectory graph.
Order cells by pseudotime and visualize the trajectory.
4. Visualize Results
The script will generate plots for:

Pseudotime trajectory: Visualizing how cells progress along the trajectory.
Gene expression: Visualizing the expression of marker genes like ALDH1A1 and SOX2 along pseudotime.
The output will include visualizations like UMAP plots and gene expression plots along pseudotime.
